# RC car using TivaC Microcontroller
We build an RC car using a TivaC MCU, which can be controlled by any smartphone via Bluetooth, and has a collision avoidance mechanism using an infrared sensor.

### Components used
* TM4C123GH6PM Board
* Infrared object detection sensor
* Serial bluetooth Module
* RC Car kit

I highly recommend this [book](https://www.amazon.com/Tiva-ARM-Programming-Embedded-Systems/dp/0997925922/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1493479542&sr=1-6&keywords=Mazidi) for interfacing with the MCU.
